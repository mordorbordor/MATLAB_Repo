# NIELIT_
This repository deals with my take-aways from lectures and projects by National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeiT), Government of India (GoI)

As a part of this repository and my endeavours, I will post projects in MATLAB, Python and other languages as I learn them along the way. 

Visitors to this section of repository are welcome to assess my progress and their feedbacks will be valued.
